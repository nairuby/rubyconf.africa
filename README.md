## Troubleshooting

### Gem Installation Issues

If you encounter errors with the following gems during setup or installation:

- `dotenv` (~> 3.1)
- `googleauth` (~> 1.14)
- `google-api-client` (~> 0.53.0)
- `google-apis-sheets_v4` (~> 0.41)

You can install them manually using these commands(Watchout for the (`gem install google-apis-sheets_v4`)):

```bash
gem install dotenv
gem install googleauth
gem install google-api-client
gem install google-apis-sheets_v4
```

After installing the gems manually, try running `make install` or `make setup` again.

## Deployment

To build the site for deployment, you can run:

```bash
bundle exec jekyll build -d public
```
