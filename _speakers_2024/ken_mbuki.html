name: "Ken Mbuki"
bio: "Business Intelligence Analyst at Moringa School"
details: "I am an expert in data analytics, data ethics, and evidence-based decision-making. I help organizations turn raw data into relevant and meaningful insights to make data-driven business decisions and accurate predictions. In my part-time, I also work as a data analytics trainer and lecturer. My current research interest is in data ethics, data-driven decision-making, and the different ethical perspectives data consumers have on the use of data in predictive analytics. I aim to help organizations develop external and internal ethics protocols on the use of data, designing ethics governance and oversight frameworks. Itâ€™s all about being thoughtful in embedding ethical values to mitigate unintended consequences that arise from unethical data practices within an organization."
