details: "Over the past eight years, SASA Technologies has delivered financial solutions in nine African countries: Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Malawi, Ghana, South Africa, Zambia, Zimbabwe, and Botswana. Our cloud-based, full-featured solutions, such as loan and agricultural management, are built in Africa, by Africans, for Africans. Using Rails and leveraging technologies like Progressive Web Apps, USSD, and SMS, we facilitate transactions between farmers, input suppliers, off-takers, and manage loans and wallets. In this talk, I'll discuss our technology stack, the patterns we use for financial transactions, and how we operate in an offline-first world. We'll explore our key technology choices and team structure that enable us to deliver world-class solutions."
