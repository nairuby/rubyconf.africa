name: "Ken Mbuki"
bio: "Business Intelligence Analyst at Moringa School"
details: " I am an expert in data analytics, data ethics, and evidence-based decision-making. I help organizations turn raw data into relevant and meaningful insights to make data-driven business decisions and accurate predictions. In my part-time, I also work as a data analytics trainer and lecturer. My current research interest is in data ethics, data-driven decision-making, and the different ethical perspectives data consumers have on the use of data in predictive analytics. I aim to help organizations develop external and internal ethics protocols on the use of data, designing ethics governance and oversight frameworks. It’s all about being thoughtful in embedding ethical values to mitigate unintended consequences that arise from unethical data practices within an organization."
