                title: "Debug Hard: Ruby String LibraryMethods and Underlying C Implementations"
                talk_description: "What if the Ruby String library 'reverse' method or its underlying C implementation had a bug?
                                    What if it produced unexpected results with certain types of inputs? e.g. strings with Unicode characters.
                                    How would you catch and fix such a bug? How would you explain the unexpected results?"
