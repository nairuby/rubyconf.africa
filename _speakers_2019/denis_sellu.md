    title: "What does a coconut and serverless have in Common"
    talk_description: "AWS Lambda has answered 'yes' to the question 'Can Rubyists come out and play' whenever Serverless knocked on the door. I want to catch up any Rubyists who are not yet familiar with the technology, so it can be another tool for the toolbox. Like coconuts, Serverless is full of delicious surprises."
