    title: "Impact of Contributing to Open Source"
    talk_description: "I became involved with Bridge Troll through first attending a RailsBridge workshop. I later volunteered and helped teach at RailsBridge workshops. Once I started to become familiar with Ruby on Rails, I began contributing to the Bridge Troll source code. The community people working on open source code are extremely friendly and helpful. I have found that working on open source projects is a good place to learn about industry standards, learn to code collaboratively, gain insight on new approaches, receive mentorship and mentor others."
