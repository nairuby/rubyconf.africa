        talk_description: "Integrating reliable two-way SMS. Voice and USSD
functionality across mobile providers in Africa can be a
daunting task for any application developer (speaking from
experience..). Our goal is to lower that barrier as much as
possible so that clients ranging from multinational companies
to budding developers can harness the immense network of
mobile carriers in the continent."
