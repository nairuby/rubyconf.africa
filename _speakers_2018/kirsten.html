        title: "Deconstructing the Monolith: designing software that maximizes developer productivity"
        talk_description: "Working with monolithic codebases can be tedious and kill developer productivity.
We’ll discuss implementation details of two possible alternatives. We’ll discuss how
to identify when an app has become a monolith in need of a refactor, and present
patterns and tools to do said refactor.
Having worked extensively in the Shopify codebase, one of the largest rails apps in
existence, I have experienced firsthand some of the downsides of working in
monolithic codebases. I have worked on a project team that extract an entire product
out of Shopify into its own app, and have lots of insights/stories to share from this
experience. On another project team, we built a microservice architecture from the
get go. I learned a lot about the topic from all of these experiences (all in Ruby) and
am excited to share some code samples, and stories of what has worked and what
hasn’t for us at Shopify."
