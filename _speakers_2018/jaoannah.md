        title: "Ruby in containers."
        talk_description: "Because of the benefits of containers, ruby applications have been containerized
recently. Containers have magically changed the way ruby applications are
managed.
This talk shall emphasize the different ways we can leverage containers and
kubernetes to deploy and run robust applications.
Containers have magically changed the way we deploy and manage ruby
applications allowing us to build, develop, test, and even deploy ruby applications on
a single system with no upgrade downtimes.
In this talk, I will talk about how we can containerize and run ruby applications on
kubernetes which is the missing layer that gives us the ability to manage many
containers by providing features that enable containers to scale, talk to each other
and work in harmony."
