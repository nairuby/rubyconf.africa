        title: "Exploring Docker for Rubyists on Window"
        talk_description: "Docker development on windows has come a long way. So long that perhaps itâ€™s
time for Ruby developers to take note and finally cross the final frontier.
Using a rails workshop as a study case, this talk explores the challenges faced in
getting set-up for basi rails development using docker on windows. It also looks to
leverage the benefits of docker over other traditional installation methods on
windows."
