        title: "Stolen Strategies; What entrepreneurs can learn from Terrorist about Corporate Strategy"
        talk_description: "A detailed look into the terrorist strategies will reveal approaches used by great
brands, business entities and personal brands all around the world. In fact, most
Fortune 500 companies practice one or more of these tactics at one point or another
during their product lifecycle. They are strategic in planning, they employ the 8-8-8.
When it comes to employment Terrorists tend to employ ‘crazy men.’ As Steve Jobs
put it “only men who think they are crazy enough to change the world are those who
do.” While nominal entrepreneur sales his brand beyond the reasonable doubt, the
terrorist sells his beyond unreasonable belief.”"
