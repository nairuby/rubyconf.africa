        title: "Reflection in Ruby: Understanding the Implications of Loading Gems and Files"
        talk_description: "Have you wondered what is provided by a gem? What about monkey patches? Can
you be sure that new changes do not conflict with old ones? We will demonstrate
how to use Ruby’s built-in reflection methods to address all of these topics, building
up from foundations available to every Ruby developer.
• Introduction to Ruby methods for detecting available classes and methods
• Detecting classes and methods made available by requiring a gem
• Detecting direct modification of existing behavior (via monkey – patching)
• Detecting indirect modification of existing behavior (module inclusion)
• Recommendations for further exploration of the topic
This live coding talk is accessible to beginners, and contains material useful for
experts
Building from tools like Object constants and Object const_get, it uses short
examples to demonstrate discovery of details from gems, monkey- patches, and
modules.
I have been refining this presentation over the last few months, giving versions of it
at B’more on Rails, NYC.rb, the New York Public Library, and (most recently) the DC
Ruby Users’ Group (to positive reviews)."
