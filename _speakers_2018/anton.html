details: "I'm Hanami core developer and an indie developer from Moscow. I work on different open source projects and builds Space-Rocket ships at night. Blurb: I think we can make ruby world better and hanami is one of library which can help with it :) The hanami is quite new and interesting framework which you are unlikely to write complex applications. But this does not mean that this framework is not worth your attention. Besides old approaches, you can also find new interesting solutions."
