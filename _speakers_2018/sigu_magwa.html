        title: "Doing CI/CD on GitLa"
        talk_description: "In agile web development, continuous integration is a critical part of the process. Did
you know you can have Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, and Continuous
Deployment within the same web interface? Learn how this is done on Gitlab
Agile methodology involves pushing code frequently and making sure nothing
breaks. Gitlab has an integrated system that allows us to continuously run tests to
avoid regression failures in our code. Also of interest is how Gitlab uses Docker and
kubernetes in achieving all these. We can have a look at how to set up for CI/CD and
a behind the scenes on what happens"
