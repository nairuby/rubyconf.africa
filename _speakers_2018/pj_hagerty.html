        talk_description: "There are thousands of local Ruby Groups worldwide. Sadly, many suffer along,
        become stagnant, some even die off. How can you make your local Ruby Group
        better and in so doing, improve the global Ruby Community?
        This talk focuses on the human side of getting a group together and making it
        successful so the members, as a group can contribute to the larger community. It is
        a university useful guide to improving all parts of the ruby community, starting on a
local level"
