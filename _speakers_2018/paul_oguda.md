        talk_description: "Formal training is advisable for many careers. However there are situations where all
you have is the passion to learn something and formal training is not for you due to a
number of issues. Self-teaching aka Auto didacticism helps one to become versed in
a new career. Career pivoting is possible through a number of avenues, self-teaching
is one of such avenues. Hence the inspiration and basis for this talk."
