        title: "A Practical Guide to Taming Wild Chatbots"
        talk_description: "The way we communicate with technology is ever-changing! From landline to the cell
phone, letters became email, emails became text messages; we are constantly
looking for effective ways of having our message understood and then getting the
richest data in response. Could Chatbots be the next step?
I have recently been playing a lot with Dialog flow, a free to use AI developed by
Google that is used in Chatbots.
The talk will go through the evolution of digital communication, what makes effective
communication and then how we could replicate that within a chatbot. I will then
take you through the process of integrating a Chabot with Facebook messager and
finally how to then get important data from the user into our rails app. This could
change the way we onboard users to our applications, and create a unique personal
touch when interacting with our users.
The talk will be half technical and a half practical. With the first portion of the talk
being how we communicate with our users and their cognitive biases with regard to
how they expect we will respond. We can then Teach Googles AI some new
interactions in real time and then see how it will react to our users. The talk will
include a practical how-to guide so that anyone sitting watching can then go home
and do exactly what they see."
