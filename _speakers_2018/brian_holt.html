        title: "Chaos Monkeys in Your Browser: What Chaos
Engineering Means for the Front End"
        talk_description: "Chaos Monkey, but for your web app. Come learn how intentional failure injection is
not only good for the back end but also for the front end. Hint: it means you’ll get
paged less at 3AM, and I think we’re all happy about that.
Chaos engineering is taking the web development world by storm, and for good
reason. Chaos engineering is the emergent methodology of intentional causing
random failures into your system. If you’re expecting your system to failure at any
time, you’ll be ready for it when actually fails, right?
This, until now, has been a back end practice: causing database read fails, app server
lockups and the like. However we as the front end have a lot to gain from intentional
failures. As an engineer at Netflix, I first hand got to see the pandemonium that
Chaos Monkey causes. But more than that I got to learn quickly where our system
came apart when failures happen. I’ll be share with you my hard-earned knowledge
of how intentional failure injection can help your system be more resilient"
